/**
 * The partitioned search: what it claims, what it refuses, and the

 * ## Why this file exists separately from `domain-partition.nodetest.mjs`
 *
 * That one tests the PLAN -- whether the four classes are true of the
 * geometry. This one tests what is built on top of a plan: the trust
 * boundary around a supplied one, the two axes the result reports on, and
 * the conditions under which each completeness flag is allowed to be true.
 *
 * Every test here was written against a specific mutation that survived a
 * bounded review of the code, and each one was confirmed to fail with that
 * mutation applied and pass without it. The mutation is named in the test.
 *
 * The fixture is `examples/synthetic-pack.mjs`: the arithmetic is real and
 * the sky is not. `Venus` there is a fast companion that laps the observer
 * every 0.7 days, so a one-day window crosses the five-degree floor three
 * times -- which is what gives these tests boundary spans to reason about
 * without needing a coefficient pack.
