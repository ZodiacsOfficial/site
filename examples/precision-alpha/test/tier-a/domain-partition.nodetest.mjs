/**
 * The domain partition: what it proves, what it declines to prove, and the
 * direction its conservatism points.
 *
 * ## Where the expected answers come from
 *
 * Nowhere near `partitionDomain`. Every fixture in this file is a geometry
 * built so that the solar elongation is an explicit function of time, and
 * every expected entry and exit instant is either that function solved in
 * closed form or bisected out of an independent reference that shares no
 * code with the operation under test. A test whose expectation came from
 * the operation's own output would pass for a partition that had lost a
 * crossing, which is the one failure the classification cannot afford.
 *
 * The trick that makes the closed forms exact is a target at a CONSTANT
 * distance from a stationary observer. The light-time is then `L/c`
 * exactly -- a fixed point the iteration reaches and does not move from --
 * so the elongation at reception time `t` is exactly the swing angle at
 * `t - L/c`, with no residual light-time approximation hiding inside the
 * expectation. The swing angle is whatever this file chooses it to be, so
 * the crossings, the tangencies and the double passages are placed rather
 * than discovered. `_geometry.mjs`'s own `tauExact` is used to CHECK that
 * claim before any case relies on it.
 *
 * Two fixtures are deliberately not of that shape: `CONJUNCTION` is
 * `heliocentricPair` through a real solar conjunction, where both bodies
 * move, the light-time is eleven minutes and varies, and the crossings can
 * only be bisected numerically; and `DRIFTING_SUN` puts the Sun somewhere
 * other than the barycentre, which is the only way to tell the reception
 * Sun in `e = O - S` from a constant.
 *
 * ## What this file can and cannot establish
 *
 * Section 8 of `PARTITION-EVALUATION.md` says it plainly: a classification
 * is a claim about every instant of a span and a test is a claim about the
 * instants it sampled. What is established here is that the conservative
 * bounds point the way they are supposed to, that the four classes tile
 * the request, that the operation never converts an undecidable geometry
 * into a verdict, and that the metamorphic relations the caching story
 * rests on hold. The soundness argument lives in `domain-partition.mjs`
 * and these are corroboration of it.
 *
 * ## One thing this file found
 *
 * `boundaryReasons` carried an `out-of-coverage` refusal for a window the
 * records do not cover, exactly as the header promised -- but only along
 * the path where `solveTau` noticed first. The sibling shape, where the
 * OBSERVER's records fall short, escaped `deriveLightTime` as a thrown
 * `PrecisionError`, because its first `stateEnclosure` calls sat in a
 * `try`/`finally` with no `catch` and `partitionDomain`'s own handler
 * takes only `budget-exhausted` and `cancelled`. One gap in the records,
 * reported two ways depending on whose records ran out. Both shapes are
 * answers now, and the test below asserts both.
