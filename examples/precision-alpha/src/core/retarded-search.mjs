 * the ICRS equator rotated by the J2000 mean obliquity, which is 23.1 mas
 * from the J2000 mean equinox; see `frame` and `frameNote` -- with
 * completeness established rather than assumed.
 *
 * This is NOT apparent-of-date astrology and must not be read as a more
 * accurate answer to the same question `empirical-apparent` answers. It
 * adds exactly one correction to `validated-geometric` -- Newtonian
 * reception light-time -- and still omits stellar aberration,
 * gravitational deflection, Shapiro delay, precession and nutation into
 * the frame of date, the IAU 2006 ICRS frame bias, topocentric parallax
 * and refraction. Those omissions are on the result object, by name.
 *
 * The scalar that is searched is a projection, not an angle:
 *
 *     f(t) = sin(L) x - cos(L) (cos(e) y + sin(e) z)
 *     g(t) = cos(L) x + sin(L) (cos(e) y + sin(e) z)
 *
 * with (x, y, z) = d(t), the light-time-corrected geocentric vector. f
 * vanishes on the whole line through the target longitude and its
 * antipode; g > 0 picks the requested direction. No wrapped angle appears
 * anywhere, so no small-difference-at-sampled-endpoints assumption is
 * needed and the 96-turn aliasing failure has nothing to act on.
 *
 * Time in and out is TDB seconds past J2000, stated as such: SPK
 * coefficients are indexed by TDB, and folding an unbounded TT or UTC
 * conversion into a proof would make the proof about something else.
