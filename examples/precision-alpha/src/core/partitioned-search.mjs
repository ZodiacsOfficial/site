/**
 * The deflected longitude search, run over a proved domain partition
 * instead of rediscovering the domain on every request.
 *
 * ## What changes, and what does not
 *
 * The event mathematics is untouched: the same `searchDeflectedLongitude`
 * runs on each admissible subinterval, with the same correction profile,
 * the same continuous vector event equations, the same half-plane test,
 * the same corrected lever arms, the same record ownership and the same
 * root metadata. What changes is that it is handed intervals it can
 * answer, instead of discovering the hard way which ones those are.
 *
 * ## Why that is worth doing
 *
 * Measured on the live runtime, the share of a deflected search's
 * evaluations spent on cells that exist only because some ancestor's
 * elongation enclosure straddled the floor: 98.9 per cent on the Moon,
 * 99.9 on Mercury, 98.9 on Saturn -- and 66.3 on a control window with no
 * conjunction in it at all. The deflection arithmetic itself is 1 to 2 per
 * cent of wall time and the domain test it gates is 0.
 *
 * ## The budget is ONE budget
 *
 * Partitioning, every subsearch and the final accounting draw on a single
 * allowance for the request. A subsearch is given what is left, not a
 * fresh copy: `maxEvaluations: remaining`. When it runs out, the spans not
 * yet reached are UNPROCESSED -- not excluded, not searched-and-empty.
 *
 * ## Five states, kept apart
 *
 * The result distinguishes, and never merges:
 *
 *   finished              the run reached its end rather than stopping
 *   complete over request  every instant of the request was accounted for
 *   exhaustive over the proved-admissible spans, which is a SMALLER claim
 *   excluded by profile    no answer at any resolution
 *   unresolved numerically  this run did not settle it
 *   unprocessed            never examined; budget or cancellation
 *
 * A request containing an excluded span is never complete over the
 * request, whatever else is true of it. And `exhaustiveOverAdmissible` is
 * deliberately scoped to the spans it names: boundary spans may hold
 * supported events, so a blanket "complete within the supported domain"
 * would be a claim about instants nobody classified.
