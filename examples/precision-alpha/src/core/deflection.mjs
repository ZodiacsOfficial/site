/**
 * Solar gravitational light deflection: the pointwise transformation.
 *
 * Profile `zodiacs-deflected-of-date/1`. `DEFLECTION-PROFILE.md` is the
 * specification and was written before this file; where the two differ the
 * document is wrong and should be corrected, not this.
 *
 * ## What this is
 *
 * Given the light-time-corrected vector from observer to source, and the
 * Sun's position at each end of the ray, this returns the NATURAL
 * direction: where the source would be seen if the observer were at rest.
 * `aberration.mjs` takes it from there.
 *
 *     w = SRS / em / max(q . (q + e), dlim)
 *     D = d + w * (d x (e x q))
 *
 * which is ERFA's `eraLd` with `bm = 1`, pinned at
 * `tools/measure/erfa-deflection/ld.c`, sha256 affa41a6028f8f2e...
 *
 * ## Three things that are easy to get wrong
 *
 * **`d` is not normalised and must not be.** `eraLd` is LINEAR in its `p`:
 * `D = (I - w[e x q]_x) d`, because `w` depends only on `q`, `e`, `em` and
 * `dlim`. So rescaling `d` by `k` rescales `D` by the same `k`.
 *
 * The domain of that argument is `k > 0`, and the restriction is not
 * cosmetic: `k < 0` reverses `D` too, which moves a longitude by 180
 * degrees and flips the sign of every projection. The search's vector is
 * positive by construction (it is a light-time-corrected separation scaled
 * by a positive factor), and the tests assert both halves -- that `k > 0`
 * leaves the direction fixed and that `k < 0` does not.
 *
 * In floating point the rescaling is EXACT only for powers of two, where
 * every product and sum scales by the same exponent shift; for a general
 * `k` both sides round differently and the two agree to within a few ulps
 * instead. The tests separate those two claims rather than asserting the
 * stronger one everywhere. The property is ERFA's own, not an artefact of
 * this transliteration: the fixture carries `eraLd` run on the raw `d` and
 * on `unit(d)` separately, and the compiled reference is itself linear to
 * 2.75e-16 relative across all 264 cases.
 *
 * **`q` and `e` are normalised and must be.** They are not scale-free.
 * Rescaling `q` by a factor `lam` while leaving its direction alone
 * multiplies the deflection by `(1 + c) / (lam + c)`, `c = q_hat . e_hat`,
 * so the relative error it induces is `(1 - lam) / (lam + c)`. Since
 * `1 + c = 1 - cos(chi)` is about `chi^2 / 2` near conjunction, a fixed
 * relative error in `|q|` is amplified by roughly `2 / chi^2`: at
 * `lam = 1.0001` and a source at 5.2 au it costs 1.8162 per cent of the
 * deflection at 5 degrees of elongation (1.421e-3 arcsec of 0.078215) and
 * 83.6912 per cent at 0.3 degrees (1.092 arcsec of 1.304493). The two
 * square roots are not optional and there is no rearrangement that avoids
 * them. Tested against that law, not against a threshold.
 *
 * **This is finite-distance, not `eraLdsun`.** `eraLdsun` calls
 * `eraLd(1, p, p, e, em, dlim)` -- passing `p` for `q`, the distant-star
 * approximation. For a planet that is wrong by up to 1.5554 arcsec (Venus,
 * 0.3 degrees elongation, near branch). `q` here is the real Sun-to-source
 * direction at emission.
 *
 * ## What the limiter is
 *
 * `dlim` is `phi^2 / 2`, where `phi` is the angular separation at which
 * limiting BEGINS (`ld.c` Note 4). Below it the deflection is artificially
 * reduced toward zero -- so the limiter does not bound the error, it
 * replaces the model with a convention that goes the wrong way.
 *
 * It is NOT an error cap. A comment in `reduce.mjs` says ERFA's `dlim`
 * "silently caps the deflection at roughly a tenth of an arcsecond"; the
 * actual peak under `dlim = 1e-6` is 5.7586 arcsec, 57.6 times that and
 * 3.29 times a limb-grazing ray's 1.7512 arcsec. That comment is about the
 * released reducer and is left alone there; it is not repeated here.
 *
 * The supported domain below is set so the limiter NEVER fires inside it.
 * `limiterActive` is reported anyway, and if it is ever true the result is
 * outside the domain and says so.

 * The closed form: the deflection angle from `chi` alone, radians.
 *
 *     tan(delta) = (SRS / em) tan(chi / 2)
 *
 * with `chi` the SUN-CENTRED angle between source and observer. It shares
 * no code with `deflect` -- it never forms `d x (e x q)` and never touches
 * `d` at all -- so agreement between the two is a real check rather than a
 * restatement.
 *
 * ## Where it comes from, and what it assumes
 *
 * `deflect` returns `u = w (d x (e x q))` with `w = SRS / em / (1 + q.e)`,
 * and `u` is perpendicular to `d`, so `tan(delta) = |u| / |d|`. Now
 * `|d x (e x q)| = |d| |e x q| sin(angle(d, e x q))`, and `e x q` is
 * normal to the plane of `e` and `q`; so IF `d` lies in that plane the
 * sine is 1 and `|d x (e x q)| = |d| sin(chi)`. With
 * `q.(q + e) = 1 + cos(chi)` that gives
 * `tan(delta) = (SRS / em) sin(chi) / (1 + cos(chi))`, and the half-angle
 * identity finishes it.
 *
 * **The coplanarity is a real assumption and it is satisfied for real
 * geometry, not by luck.** `e` is Sun to observer and `q` is Sun to
 * source, so `d = |q| q_hat - |e| e_hat` is a linear combination of the
 * two and lies in their plane identically. The identity therefore holds at
 * finite source distance exactly as it does for a distant star; it is not
 * a small-angle or far-field approximation. It would fail for a `d` that
 * did not come from this geometry, and `deflect` would still compute the
 * model correctly for such a `d` -- that is why this is a separate
 * function and not an optimisation of that one.
 *
 * ## The atan
 *
 * `(SRS / em) tan(chi / 2)` is the TANGENT of the deflection, not the
 * deflection. Dropping the `atan` is harmless where the deflection is
 * small but reaches 1.41e-11 relative at the fixture's `chi = 179.69`
 * degrees; it is kept so the function returns an angle at every `chi`
 * rather than one that is only asymptotically an angle.
 *
 * This is NOT an independent model. It is the same `eraLd` first-order
 * model reached by a different algebraic route, so it checks the
 * arithmetic and the vector algebra, not the physics. The independent
 * check on the model itself is the ray integration in
 * `DEFLECTION-PROFILE.md` section 0.

// --------------------------------------------------------------- intervals

/**
 * The same transformation over an INTERVAL of reception times, together
 * with its first derivative, for the validated search.
 *
 * ## What the linearity buys, and what it does not
 *
 * `deflect` is linear in `d` (proved and measured in
 * `DEFLECTION-PROFILE.md` section 11.2), so the search's deliberately
 * unnormalised vector goes in as it stands: no rescaling, and no interval
 * division to make it a unit vector.
 *
 * **That licence does not extend to `q` and `e`.** They are not
 * scale-free -- section 11.3 gives the two laws and measures what getting
 * them wrong costs -- so both are normalised here, with the interval
 * division that implies, and both denominators are checked away from zero
 * rather than assumed positive.
 *
 * **Nor does it extend to `|d|` downstream.** The map from `d` to `D` is
 * linear but it is NOT a positive scalar multiple: it is
 * `(I - w[e x q]_x)`, a genuine linear map, so an enclosure of `|d|`
 * is not an enclosure of `|D|` and cannot be passed on as one. Aberration
 * takes the length as a separate argument and uses it inside
 * `S = |d| + (d.v)/(1 + bm1)`, so handing it the old length beside the new
 * vector would evaluate a function that is neither transformation. This
 * returns `dist` and `distDot` for `D`, recomputed.
 *
 * The size of that difference is not the reason to recompute, but it is
 * worth knowing: `u` is perpendicular to `d`, so `|D| = |d| sec(delta)`.
 * The largest deflection the supported domain allows is 0.094847 arcsec
 * -- five degrees of elongation, a distant source, the observer at
 * perihelion -- which puts `sec(delta) - 1` at 1.057e-13 and below.
 * Small enough to vanish into the same double at many geometries, and
 * still not the same number. The reason to recompute is structural.
 *
 * ## The derivatives, derived rather than differenced
 *
 *     en' = (E . E')/en          e' = (E' - e en')/en
 *     qn' = (Q . Q')/qn          q' = (Q' - q qn')/qn
 *     g   = q.(q + e)            g' = q'.(q + e) + q.(q' + e')
 *     den = em g                 den' = em' g + em g'

 *     D   = d + w x              D'  = d' + w' x + w x'
 *
 * `Q` is the Sun-to-target vector at EMISSION and `Q'` is differentiated
 * with respect to RECEPTION time, so the caller supplies the
 * `(1 - dtau/dt)` factor; doing it here would hide a chain rule in a
 * routine that cannot see the light-time.
 *
 * ## The limiter is not differentiated -- it is excluded
 *
 * `w` above has no `max` in it, and that is a claim about this cell, not a
 * simplification. `dlim` is a clamp, so `w` is piecewise and its
 * derivative jumps across the threshold (measured in the tests). Rather
 * than differentiate through it, this REFUSES any cell whose `g` enclosure
 * is not provably above the largest `dlim` the cell admits. Inside the
 * supported domain that is never close -- five degrees of elongation puts
 * `g` about 3.8e-3 against a `dlim` of 1e-6 -- but it is checked on every
 * cell rather than inferred from the domain guard.
 *
 * ## Refusing rather than throwing, and excluded rather than unresolved
 *
 * Like `aberrateInterval`, every failure comes back as
 * `{ok: false, retry, why}` so the search can subdivide or record it. One
 * addition: `excluded: true` marks a cell the PROFILE declines to answer
 * for -- the geometry is inside the elongation floor -- as opposed to one
 * the arithmetic could not decide. The two must not be merged: a narrower
 * cell resolves the second and never the first, and a result that counted
 * an excluded span as covered would be claiming completeness over a region
