/**
 * Newtonian reception light-time, with enclosures that are true of the
 * stored polynomial.
 *
 * The quantity. For a RECEPTION time t, the target is taken at its
 * EMISSION time and the observer at the reception time:
 *
 *     tau = | r_T(t - tau) - r_O(t) | / c
 *     d(t) = r_T(t - tau(t)) - r_O(t)
 *
 * The observer is NOT evaluated at t - tau. Retarding both ends -- which
 * is what happens if a single geocentric vector is formed first and then
 * shifted -- is a different and wrong quantity, and it is the mistake
 * this file exists to avoid. The two sums are kept apart throughout:
 * `targetWeights` and `observerWeights` never merge.
 *
 * Time is TDB seconds past J2000, which is what SPK coefficients are
 * indexed by. No TT or UTC conversion happens anywhere in here; a
 * conversion with an unbounded error has no place inside a proof.
 *
 * What is established, and how:
 *
 *   EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS come from Banach, not from two iterates
 *   agreeing. Phi(tau) = |r_T(t - tau) - r_O(t)|/c has
 *   Phi'(tau) = -(u . v_T(t - tau))/c, so |Phi'| <= max|v_T|/c over the
 *   emission interval -- and max|v_T| is taken from `sum |c_k|` of the
 *   differentiated series, which is true of the polynomial. The
 *   self-mapping Phi(T) subset T is then CHECKED on a candidate interval
 *   T rather than assumed, and a failure is reported, not widened away
 *   forever.
 *
 *   THE DERIVATIVE comes through the implicit equation:
 *
 *     tau' = u . (v_T - v_O) / (c + u . v_T)
 *     d'   = v_T(t - tau) (1 - tau') - v_O(t)
 *
 *   not from rotating a geometric velocity.
 *
 *   SEGMENT CROSSINGS are handled by walking every record the emission
 *   interval touches and taking the union of the per-record enclosures.
 *   Nothing is clamped into one record and nothing is extrapolated past
 *   the stored data.
 *
 * Environment-neutral: no `node:` imports, no clock.
