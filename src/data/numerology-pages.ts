In Pythagorean numerology the birth date supplies the Life Path: month, day, and year each become a digit or a master number; the three are then added and brought down once more. When that final total is 11 it stays 11. The tradition reads a life organised around intuition, sensitivity, and the restlessness of noticing more than most people do.",
      "Four totals give an 11 — 11 itself, plus 29, 38, and 47, which add to 11 and stop there. None of the four is a karmic debt number. The share of birth dates from 1900 to 2099 that reach an 11 is about 6.1 per cent.",
