/**
 * When each country's civil calendar changed to the Gregorian (New Style),
 * for the birth forms' calendar notes (engine brief step 1.13b). Loaded only
 * with the calendar control, never in a page's first bundle.
 *
 * One date per present-day country: the first New Style day where most of
 * that country's births were recorded. Where regions changed at different
 * times, the row's comment says which region the date belongs to and names
 * the others. `lastJulian` is the Old Style day before it, for countries whose
 * earlier civil calendar was the Julian (for Turkey, the Rumi calendar, which
 * kept Julian days and months). The five countries whose earlier calendar was
 * a different one have no `lastJulian`: the site cannot convert from those,
 * and their note says so.
 *
 * `country` is the name the GeoNames city index gives the country
 * (public/data/cities/index.json), which is the only country field a picked
 * birthplace carries; `code` is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, used for the
 * country's name in the reader's language.
 *
 * Sources, cited per row (dates are encyclopaedic facts; no prose is copied):
 * - wikipedia: "List of adoption dates of the Gregorian calendar by country",
 *   English Wikipedia, read 2026-09-25; its rows cite Grotefend, Ginzel and
 *   the laws that made each change.
 * - tzdb: the IANA time zone database 2025c (the release this site pins in
 *   scripts/build-tz-lmt.mjs), file `calendars`, which quotes H. Grotefend,
 *   Taschenbuch der Zeitrechnung (1941), pp. 26–28. Public domain.
 * - lv, fi: the Latvian and Finnish Wikipedia articles on the Gregorian
 *   calendar ("Gregora kalendārs", "Gregoriaaninen kalenteri"), read
 *   2026-09-25, where the English list is silent or the sources disagree.
