Modern personality summaries often call it resourceful; that is a cultural association, not a measured trait.' },

The image emphasizes sustained work rather than speed.' },
  { slug: 'tiger', name: 'Tiger', branch: '寅', branchPinyin: 'yín', position: 3, association: 'Traditionally associated with courage, force, and protection.', context: 'The Tiger carries a protective as well as a bold register in Chinese visual culture. Short personality lists capture only one use of the symbol.' },
  { slug: 'rabbit', name: 'Rabbit', branch: '卯', branchPinyin: 'mǎo', position: 4, association: 'Traditionally associated with vigilance, grace, and careful movement.', context: 'English sources may use Rabbit or Hare. Regional zodiac traditions can name a different animal, which is one reason this guide stays specific to the Chinese cycle.' },
  { slug: 'dragon', name: 'Dragon', branch: '辰', branchPinyin: 'chén', position: 5, association: 'Traditionally associated with auspicious power, vitality, and authority.', context: 'The Dragon is the sequence’s mythic animal. It carries a different cultural register from the adversarial dragon familiar in much European storytelling.' },

Interpretive traits vary by source, family, and region; the calendar position is the stable fact.' },
  { slug: 'horse', name: 'Horse', branch: '午', branchPinyin: 'wǔ', position: 7, association: 'Traditionally associated with effort, bravery, resilience, and movement.', context: 'The Horse is seventh in the sequence. Smithsonian material for the 2026 Fire Horse foregrounds hard work, bravery, and resilience.' },
  { slug: 'goat', name: 'Goat', branch: '未', branchPinyin: 'wèi', position: 8, association: 'Traditionally associated with care, harmony, and creative cultivation.', context: 'Goat, Ram, and Sheep all appear in English-language renderings. The underlying Chinese term does not force the same species distinction English does.' },
  { slug: 'monkey', name: 'Monkey', branch: '申', branchPinyin: 'shēn', position: 9, association: 'Traditionally associated with ingenuity, play, and quick adjustment.', context: 'The Monkey is ninth. Folklore and popular personality readings add layers beyond the calendrical animal; those layers are not uniform across all Chinese communities.' },
  { slug: 'rooster', name: 'Rooster', branch: '酉', branchPinyin: 'yǒu', position: 10, association: 'Traditionally associated with diligence, timekeeping, and industriousness.', context: 'The Met notes the rooster’s early rising as the basis for associations with diligence and industry, while also documenting its long use as an auspicious art motif.' },
  { slug: 'dog', name: 'Dog', branch: '戌', branchPinyin: 'xū', position: 11, association: 'Traditionally associated with loyalty, watchfulness, and protection.', context: 'The Dog is eleventh. As on every page in this guide, the association describes a tradition of interpretation, not a personality diagnosis.' },
