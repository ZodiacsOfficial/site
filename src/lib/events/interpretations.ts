      'The Leo–Aquarius axis is personal warmth against the wider circle: your name on the work versus the group that makes the work possible. With the Moon at 6° Aquarius, the tradition reads a culmination in the collective part of life — friendships, teams, audiences, the future you are pointing at — while the Leo Sun keeps the question personal. Something you have been building since the quiet Cancer new moon of July 14 is now visible to other people, and their reaction is information.',
      'The timing has texture. Mercury finished its retrograde on July 23, so conversations that stalled through mid-July have started moving again; Saturn turned retrograde in Aries on July 26, opening a slower, half-year review of commitments made since February. A full moon three days into that turn tends to feel like a checkpoint rather than a finale — see what is finished, and let what is not finished be openly unfinished.',

    body: [
      'Ordinary new moons are for quiet starts; astrologers tend to read eclipse new moons as doors that open on their own schedule. At 20° Leo the register is creative and personal — authorship, romance, performance, the parts of life where you are most yourself in public. Whatever begins near this date, the tradition suggests holding plans loosely: eclipse beginnings often look different a season later.',
      'This is also the middle of an eclipse pair. A partial lunar eclipse follows at the Pisces full moon on August 28, closing the season two weeks later. Reading the two dates as one story — a Leo opening, a Pisces release — is the older way to work with them.',

    body: [
      'A solar eclipse is a new moon with exact aim: the Moon always passes between Earth and Sun at a new moon, but only when the line-up crosses the Moon\'s orbital nodes does it actually block the light. The tradition has read these interruptions for millennia as markers — endings and beginnings compressed into a single afternoon. Modern astrologers keep the reading but soften the fatalism: an eclipse in Leo asks where your creative and personal authority is headed, and tends to answer the question faster than you would have.',
      'Eclipses arrive in pairs. This one opens the season; the partial lunar eclipse at the Pisces full moon on August 28 closes it. The two weeks between them have a reputation for being eventful — a reputation worth neither fearing nor engineering.

    body: [
      'Retrograde motion is perspective, not reversal — Earth overtaking a slower line of sight — but the tradition\'s advice for these three weeks has stayed consistent for centuries: review instead of launch. Reread before sending. Confirm the booking. Expect the person from earlier in the summer to resurface. With the whole retrograde in Cancer, the classic themes tilt homeward: plans involving family, houses, and who-hosts-what are the likeliest places to find a crossed wire.',
      'The turnaround days deserve the most patience. Mercury stationed retrograde on June 29 and stations direct on July 23, and the standstill days on either end are when devices, schedules, and inboxes have their folklore moments. By the July 29 full moon the fog has usually burned off.',

Saturn changes sign roughly every two and a half years, and each shift moves its slow work to a new part of everyone\'s chart.',
    body: [
      'Saturn in Aries is discipline applied to beginnings: the tradition reads it as a multi-year test of initiative, where starting things — and owning what you start — carries more weight and more scrutiny. What was diffuse during the Pisces years gets asked for its concrete form. The classic caution is impatience wearing the costume of decisiveness; the classic reward is self-reliance that has actually been earned.',
      'Saturn does not arrive alone. Neptune crossed into Aries three weeks earlier, on January 26, which is why astrologers talk about early 2026 as a genuine change of scenery: two of the slowest-moving planets stepping onto the zodiac\'s starting line within a month of each other. Saturn will spend late July to mid-December retrograde in Aries — the first review period of the new chapter.',

    lead: 'On July 18, 2026, Uranus in Gemini and Pluto in Aquarius reach an exact trine at 4° of the air signs — two of the slowest planets in the sky agreeing with each other. Aspects like this one are measured in generations, not weeks; the exact date is simply when the agreement is sharpest.',
    body: [
      'Uranus is the tradition\'s circuit breaker, Pluto its deep renovation, and a trine is the easy angle — 120°, signs of the same element, effort flowing rather than grinding. In air signs the shared project is ideas, language, networks, and how people organize themselves. Read collectively, it describes a stretch when structural change and technical change stop fighting each other. Read personally, it rewards whichever experiment you have been running quietly since the decade turned.',
      'The date sits inside a remarkable week: within seven days the sky also produces Jupiter\'s exact opposition to Pluto and its trine to Neptune, all near the same early degrees. Mid-July 2026 is the kind of sky astrologers mark years in advance — not because a single day changes anything, but because so many slow cycles pass their exact marks at once. Pluto is retrograde through it all, which the tradition reads as the renovation running on its internal schedule.',

    reflections: [

    body: [
      'Jupiter is appetite and reach; Saturn is limit and load-bearing wall. Square or opposed, they argue. In trine, the argument becomes a division of labor: ambition gets a schedule, and discipline gets a reason. With Jupiter in Leo the growth is creative and personal — visibility, authorship, heart — while Saturn in Aries supplies the independent spine. Plans made near this date tend to be the durable kind, sized to what you can actually build.',
      'Saturn is retrograde at the exactitude, mid-way through its first Aries review, which softens the moment from a green light into an honest drafting table: the trine favors committing to the structure of the thing rather than its launch party. The angle stays within a workable orb for weeks on either side of the exact hit.',
