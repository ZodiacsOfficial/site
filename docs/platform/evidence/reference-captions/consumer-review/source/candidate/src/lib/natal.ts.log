  'Venus:conjunction:Mars': 'Your Venus is fused to your Mars — wanting and pursuing fire together; the charm has momentum, and the appetite has taste.',
  'Moon:square:Saturn': 'Your Moon grinds against your Saturn — feelings meet a strict doorman, and the early lesson that comfort must be earned takes deliberate unlearning.',
  'Sun:conjunction:Mercury': 'Your Sun is fused to your Mercury — the self and its narrator share a desk, which makes the account vivid and the distance between you and your own opinions small.',
  'Sun:sextile:Mars': 'Your Sun has an open line to your Mars — a clear purpose can give you the push to begin. Choose a first step small enough to take while the intention is fresh.',

  'Sun:conjunction:Venus': 'Your Sun is fused to your Venus — what you value can be closely tied to how you see yourself. Notice which preferences remain yours when nobody else is there to approve them.',

  'Sun:sextile:Pluto': 'Your Sun has an open line to your Pluto — an honest look beneath the surface can clarify your next direction. Start with one pattern you have the power to change.',

  'Mars:trine:Neptune': 'Your Mars runs downhill into your Neptune — an image, cause, or creative practice can draw effort from you without much forcing. Notice which inspiration still supports action after the first rush fades.',
  'Sun:opposition:Mars': 'Your Sun faces off with your Mars — pursuing your direction and answering a challenge can pull you into different positions. Decide what you want before letting a contest set the terms.',
  'Sun:conjunction:Neptune': 'Your Sun is fused to your Neptune — imagination can be woven into your sense of self, making possibilities feel personal. Let a vision guide an experiment without requiring it to explain your whole life.',
  'Venus:conjunction:Pluto': 'Your Venus is fused to your Pluto — affection and taste can invite deep investment. Make room to name what you want and to hear a different answer without turning closeness into a test.',

  'Moon:square:Mercury': 'Your Moon grinds against your Mercury — the explanation that makes sense may not match the feeling underneath it. Give each a separate sentence before asking them to agree.',
