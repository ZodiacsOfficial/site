/**
 * Phase 5A pilot copy composition and content-depth measurement.
 *
 * Every reader-facing sentence about a person is composed here from that
 * person's computed chart facts. Nothing is copied from Wikipedia; no
 * biography, achievement, or private-life material enters the copy; no
 * placement is said to have caused anything. Third-person pronouns for
 * the subject are avoided entirely — the name or "the chart" carries the
 * sentence, so no page ever guesses a living person's pronouns.
 *
 * House practice: this is the same deterministic composition-from-a-
 * curated-phrase-library the daily engine uses (PLAN.md, Phase 1). The
 * variety between pages comes from the facts, not from paraphrase.
