# Publish the current HEAD to a protected branch through a pull request.
#
# The protection rule on main requires changes to arrive through a pull
# request, so a workflow's direct push dies with GH006. This satisfies the
# rule literally instead of bypassing it: push HEAD to a short-lived publish
# branch, open a pull request with the workflow token, squash-merge it once
# GitHub reports it mergeable, and delete the branch. No bypass actor, no
# extra secret. It fails closed — leaving the pull request open for a
# person — when the token may not open pull requests (a repository Actions
# setting) or when the rule also demands approvals or status checks that a
# workflow cannot supply for its own pull request.
#
# Usage: publish-through-pr.sh <base-branch> <verified-base-sha> <title> [body]
# Prints the merged base-branch SHA as its last line of stdout.
